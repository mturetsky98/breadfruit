The breadfruit tree is magnificent when mature, tall and broad branched, with large glossy leaves.  It provides shade and through its impressive spherical fruit, nutritious food.

Like many plants, it has been moved great distances, far beyond its own propagation range  through human agency determined to benefit from it. It began in the Pacific, and as Zerega et al point out, it has been cultivated there for thousands of years. The Pacific is an enormous oceanic space (30 percent  of the earth, 155 sq. kilometers or 60 million sq miles, and bigger than all the continents combined). Since the breadfruit became a staple food for islanders, it was taken by them when they travelled to establish new settlements.

Because it was spread through the Pacific Islands by human migration, its presence is part of the evidence for understanding patterns in those movements. Human selection for particular properties over a long time has resulted variations in the tree’s being and behavior  (760), including the predominance of seedless varieties and the loss of beneficial fungi. Zerega et all calls this “loss of fertility,” resulting from a condition called “triploidy” (760). This is caused by having three sets of chromosomes, but this loss is offset for humans by  resulting in greater vigor, dark green leaves and larger flowers or fruit.

As this video makes clear, the breadfruit still has a very important role in Pacific culture. Diane Ragone, who appears in the video, is a prominent researcher on the tree. She and Catherine G. Cavaletto tell us that breadfruit is “currently grown in 86 countries and 26 additional countries have ecological conditions suitable for its cultivation” (335).    Breadfruit is especially popular in the Caribbean, which is why its’ complicated history there is particularly important. They go on:

> Islanders have selected, named and grown hundreds of cultivars, distinguished by the following: the presence or absence of seeds; shape, size, skin, or flesh texture of the fruit; cooking or storage qualities; leaf shape; and fruiting season. (335)

A cultivar is a plant variety produced through selective breeding, and breadfruit has been cultivated for so long, it is appropriate to think of breadfruit as diverse not only in location but in identity. Comparing the world distribution map for the breadfruit with the modern map of the Pacific shows how solidly established to breadfruit is in that region. This map shows Tahiti, the island to which Captain Cook sailed on all three of his voyages to the Pacific (1772) , greatly assisted by a new clock  designed to measure longitude. The British were competing with the French to win naval advantage by being able to calculate longitude accurately.

White planters in the Caribbean had complained because trade after the American Revolution (1776 on) complicated their acquisition of cheap food for the enslaved. Richard Drayton reports that by the 1770s there were plans to move “Asian plants” to the Caribbean:
> In early 1772 Valentine Morris, Governor of St. Vincent, urged Banks that the introduction of the breadfruit tree would be  ‘a great blessing  and benefit’ to the West Indies. Finally in 1775 the planters of Jamaica…voted in their legislature to create two extensive botanic gardens and to place the cost of a full-time botanist on the charge of the colony.

Sir Joseph Banks, referred to in this quotation,  had accompanied Captain Cook on his first voyage to the Pacific (1768-1771). Gentleman botanist, he was keen on collecting useful plants: he would set up a  botanical garden at Kew in 1772 with his monarch’s blessing and on his monarch’s land. Banks came up with the idea that breadfruit was a perfect food because it requires no work, therefore no expense: speaking of Pacific islanders, he writes: “Their chiefest sustenance Bread fruit is procurd with no more trouble than that of climbing a tree and pulling it down.”

The representation of Pacific island societies as places of idyllic idleness and of the breadfruit as  food requiring no labor or cost led to Captain Bligh being  sent to Tahiti in 1789  to obtain cuttings:

> This day we took the plants on board, being 774 pots, all in a healthy state; for whenever any plant had an unfavourable appearance, it was replaced by another. The number of those rejected was 302….The natives reckon eight kinds of the breadfruit tree, each of which they distinguish with a different name. I. Patteah. 2. Eroroo. 3. Awanna. 4. MI-re. 5. Oree. 6. Powerro. 7. Appeere. 8. Rowdeeah. In the first, fourth and eighth class, the leaf differs from the rest…The difference of the fruit is principally in the first and eighth class.
Bligh was thwarted in his first attempt to transport the breadfruit by the famous Mutiny on his ship, The Bounty, (1789) but he returned to finish the job and delivered several hundred plants to St. Vincent in the Caribbean in 1793.

The breadfruit’s journeys across time and space can be illustrated by the number of careful botanical illustrations of it, often achieved to the level of art and over a long period of time.  There are striking images from many places including Fiji and Puerto Rico, also one generically ascribed to Asia. These often show the male spike and the female flower as well as leaves. In 1796,  three years after Bligh got the plant to the Caribbean, J. Pass did a colored etching which interprets the breadfruit a little oddly, despite getting it mostly right (the fruit is not golden like a mango when ripe).

Culturally specific landscape painting, without people usually, can also creep into illustrative composition as in   British William Daniell’s 1809 colored aquatint - and actually  the tree looks nothing like the breadfruit and might be the jackfruit 
(Artocarpus heterophyllus).

An anonymous illustration, against British, dated c. 1827, groups the breadfruit, again with yellow fruit, with mandrake (Mandragora officinarum) and cudweed (Gnaphalium species), the name on the drawing.- perhaps to suggest the breadfruit belongs in Britain/Europe?   Mandrake, a Mediterranean member of the nightshade family  has a root which suggests the shape of humans and so was given magical qualities. Cudweed is described variously as a member of the daisy and sunflower family (which are the same family generally but those two of different genus). The British variant is believed to have been brought from mainland Europe in ancient times and almost became extinct. It is interesting (and quite colonial) that the breadfruit, in inaccurate representation, is thus claimed by British horticultural history at a time of colonial expansion.

Another British botanical illustration of 1828 is more accurate and detailed, published in Curtis’s Botanical Magazine. This one is a hand colored engraving and the green used is  reasonably faithful to the breadfruit’s color, which suggests a desire to be fair to the plant as opposed to framing it for people in the cultural locale which wanted the image made.

Images from Asia over time show a similar range from the strictly botanical interpreted by a gifted artist to the plant or fruit in social context. One from an “album” of watercolors of Asian fruits and flowers (dated 1798-1850) is very accurately observed and colored.

Early photography (1890-1910)  delivers an image of a Fijian man carrying breadfruit tied to a stick over his shoulder.: in this the fruit is part of a portrait of a person. The man is turned to the camera and looks levelly into it, conveying a strength and reserve which refuses the colonizing gaze- Fiji became a British  Crown Colony in 1874.

Cook and Banks were both impressed by the importance of breadfruit in Pacific culture.  A striking example of this is Cook’s careful observation of the disposition of a dead person’s body ( who has been shot by Cook’s people). Items to nurture the spirit in the afterlife were placed close to the body, including “a few pieces of Bread fruit roasted ready for eating.” In 1920, William Popenoe’s description in a book shows the breadfruit as an interesting and important plant.- perhaps the two most important parts of his account for us here are his attention to the breadnut and his remark that in 1920 as he wrote this, there was very little scientific study of the breadfruit.

The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="984,1,1576,1319">Caribbean</span> is accurately depicted in an early map (1736), showing it had been carefully traversed at that early stage, since Columbus arrived in the early 1490s, despite longitude still not being clearly recorded then.  Colonization began in Barbados in 1627. Winds off the West African coast blow straight across the Caribbean, as we can see with hurricane tracks these days. This faciltated the slave ships and also Bligh’s breadfruit voyage in 1793.  St. Vincent, his first port of call, lies less than a hundred miles to the West of Barbados. Jamaica, where reputedly Bligh delivered the healthiest breadfruit saplings, 
is a thousand miles from the Eastern Caribbean.

Jill Casid’s wonderful book, Sowing Empire: Landscape and Colonization includes an account of the breadfruit’s arrival  and role in Jamaica during slavery. She points out that prominent Jamaican planter and writer Edward Long has been called "the father of English racism”   for his stated view that Europeans and people of African descent are two different species. Her apt term for the breadfruit is  “the most infamous of colonial plant grafts”, the breadfruit, which slave-owner, promoter of the plantation system and English M.P. Bryan Edwards placed at the frontispiece for the second edition of his History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies, published at a time of growing support for ending slavery.    This makes clear how intensely the breadfruit was dragged into the vision of the world which increasingly entrenched racism wished to establish, in which plants, like subordinated people, had whatever meaning and function the powerful desired.  The turning point for the breadfruit came after Emancipation when some Caribbean people, struggling to make a living as free people in territories still owned and dominated by white colonials, did indeed begin to find it helpful in hard times, though this would give it association over time with the poorest of a given society. Once a family had a little bit more money, they turned to rice or potatoes, neither of which is as nutritious as breadfruit.

Caribbean literature, from the twentieth century, provides us with a sense of how the breadfruit has entered cultural and individual imagination in the region. Derek Walcott, Nobel laureate, born in St. Lucia in the Eastern Caribbean in 1930, makes the breadfruit a key  element in “The Bounty”,  his moving poetic elegy for his mother,  Alix.

The poem  plays with the idea of bounty as the plenty of natural harvest and as Bligh’s ship’s name. The breadfruit appears early: “the breadfruit opens its palms in praise of the bounty, /bois-pain, tree of bread, slave food...” Bois-pain is literally bread fruit: St Lucia had both French and English colonizers: everyone understands and speaks English but the creole is French-based. This image of the breadfruit as having palms, hands with fingers, reflects the shape of the leaf. This comes back in section iii of the poem, “the breadfruit’s palms.”

It is likely that Walcott saw a film of the Bounty Mutiny . The story would have been popular in the years of his childhood ( just as the Bounty bar, coconut based, was sold along with other British confectionary). The Mutiny inspired a number of films over decades, each one reflecting the era of their making and social issues at the time which film-makers thought urgent. The one released in 1935 starred Clark Gable as the mutinous Fletcher Christian  and Charles Laughton and focused on naval labor issues, with Laughton as an irascible, unjust Captain Bligh. In 1962, an epic remake, with much footage of Tahiti, had Marlon Brando as Christian and Trevor Howard as Bligh, once more focusing on Bligh as a poor captain and depicting Christian as deeply engaged with Tahitian life. In actual fact, after the Mutiny, the mutineers escaped to Pitcairn Island with Tahitian wives. In the 1962 film, there is footage of the breadfruit plants being thrown overboard as a first declaration of control by the mutineers after Bligh is forced into a longboat with his loyal crew and made to leave the ship.    Walcott depicts this in his poem, “the God-captain is cast adrift/by a mutinous Christian, in the wake of the turning Argo/ plants bob in the ocean’s furrows, their shoots dip and lift,..." The Bounty is imaged as Jason’s ship Argo, sent in a Greek myth to retrieve the Golden Fleece:  Bligh is sent to retrieve the breadfruit, which gives a certain mythological quality to Walcott’s reference to the sordid story. The poem embraces the breadfruit as a part of the bounty of nature of St. Lucia but also a link to a troubled colonial past which brought it there.

Barbadian Austin Clarke’s racy and absorbing culinary memoir, _Pig Tails ‘n Breadfruit_ (1999) has a chapter on a very popular dish in the island, breadfruit cou-cou. Cou-cou, phonetically closely related to fufu, a Twi word meaning mash, is likely descended from West African food preparation practice, changed over time to become a Barbadian dish. Clarke deliberately ( and amusingly) misleads by conflating Bligh with “people who sail from England to Africa, carrying nails and muskets and knives and top hats to trade with the Africans, for slaves.”    He also, ( and this reverberates with our survey of some of the many illustrations of plants which were important to British colonial botany), comically makes Bligh a sketcher of plants he finds in Africa. Clarke also mentions something which Banks noticed in his experience of breadfruit and which is also mentioned in a Trinidad calypso in the voice of the breadfruit: it produces intestinal gas.   Clarke tells a story which is both funny and painful:
> After you eat breadfruit, the gas is so distinctive, and is sensed so far and wide and long, that the slave-catcher and the Plantation manager uses to love it and love slaves who eat breadfruit. The slaves could no longer hide! Not after a nice, heavy meal o’ breadfruit cou-cou. The gas they passed betrayed them. My own mother tell me this.
This story reveals how deeply involved with slavery and issues of hunger and brutality the breadfruit has become in the Caribbean. But also Clarke sets out the recipe for this beloved local dish.  Clarke declares that from a “bad, disreputable journey” of the breadfruit to the Caribbean, something good has “spring up”, “a green and large harvest of breadfruits.”
