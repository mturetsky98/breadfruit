The breadfruit tree is magnificent when mature, tall and broad branched, with large glossy leaves.  It provides shade and through its impressive spherical fruit, nutritious food.

Like many plants, it has been moved great distances, far beyond its own propagation range  through human agency determined to benefit from it. It began in the Pacific, and as Zerega et al point out, it has been cultivated there for thousands of years. The Pacific is an enormous oceanic space (30 percent  of the earth, 155 sq. kilometers or 60 million sq miles, and bigger than all the continents combined). Since the breadfruit became a staple food for islanders, it was taken by them when they travelled to establish new settlements.

Because it was spread through the Pacific Islands by human migration, its presence is part of the evidence for understanding patterns in those movements. Human selection for particular properties over a long time has resulted variations in the tree’s being and behavior  (760), including the predominance of seedless varieties and the loss of beneficial fungi. Zerega et all calls this “loss of fertility,” resulting from a condition called “triploidy” (760). This is caused by having three sets of chromosomes, but this loss is offset for humans by  resulting in greater vigor, dark green leaves and larger flowers or fruit.

As this video makes clear, the breadfruit still has a very important role in Pacific culture. Diane Ragone, who appears in the video, is a prominent researcher on the tree. She and Catherine G. Cavaletto tell us that breadfruit is “currently grown in 86 countries and 26 additional countries have ecological conditions suitable for its cultivation” (335).    Breadfruit is especially popular in the Caribbean, which is why its’ complicated history there is particularly important. They go on:

> Islanders have selected, named and grown hundreds of cultivars, distinguished by the following: the presence or absence of seeds; shape, size, skin, or flesh texture of the fruit; cooking or storage qualities; leaf shape; and fruiting season. (335)

A cultivar is a plant variety produced through selective breeding, and breadfruit has been cultivated for so long, it is appropriate think of breadfruit as a diverse not only in location but in identity.
